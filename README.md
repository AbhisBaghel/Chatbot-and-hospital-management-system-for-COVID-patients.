# Chatbot-and-hospital-management-system-for-COVID-patients
Currently, In India and the world, there are not many people who have the right knowledge of COVID-19. And there is lots of fake news and information spreading all over. We are using Machine learning and web scraping to answer the questions of people. The web app is being used for hospital management wherein the patients can log in to the account and then get information regarding the services of the hospitals. Along with it the patient can make appointments to the doctor after making correct symptom recognition and get to know the disease he/she is suffering from. Along with there is a login page and the contact page. The feedback form helps to collect information regarding the patients and we can use that as a dataset for training and implementing the machine learning algorithm. Also, it consists of a dashboard for the hospital staff to collect information about the patients, their mails and the reports of their illness located at one server to get the information easily and quickly. The chatbot addresses the problems asked by the patients and then keeps a check on the fake news and then we can keep control over the mental well-being of the patients along with their physical health, Hence this is the complete project for the benefit of COVID patients worldwide.
